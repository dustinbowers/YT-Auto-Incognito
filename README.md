# YT-Auto-Incognito
This extension will automatically open a YouTube video link in incognito mode if the *Ad Blockers are against TOS* popup occurs. If you have an adblocker enabled in incognito mode, this will allow you to watch YouTube videos without watching ads.

**NOTE:** You must allow your adblocker to run in incognito mode for this extension to be effective

### How to use

First, ensure that your preferred Ad Blocker is allow to run in Incognito mode (I recommend [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm) if you don't already have one)
```
1. In a new Incognito window, go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Find the ad-blocking extension that you want to allow in Incognito mode.
3. Click Details.
4. Turn on Allow in Incognito.
